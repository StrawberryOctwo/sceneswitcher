For millions of women over 60,
bladder leakage is a daily struggle that limits their activities,
travel plans,
and social interactions.
The fear of embarrassing accidents can be crippling,
robbing them of their confidence and freedom.
Traditional solutions like disposable pads
and adult diapers are often bulky,
and uncomfortable,
and expensive.
They're visible under clothing
and create a lot of waste.
Women deserve a better solution
that lets them live life on their own terms.
Hi, I'm Jess, the creator of DryCloud leak-proof underwear.
When my mom started struggling with incontinence,
I saw firsthand how it affected her life.
As a fashion designer,
I knew there had to be a better way.
I set out to create underwear
that would give women like my mom their dignity
and independence back.
Introducing DryCloud leak-proof underwear.
They look and feel just like regular underwear
but feature a thin,
super-absorbent lining
that traps and locks in moisture.
The breathable fabric prevents odors and irritation.
With DryCloud, no one will ever know you're wearing leak-proof underwear.
We've been blown away by the response to DryCloud.
In just two years, we've sold over a million pairs
to women in 50 countries.
My dream of helping women like my mom
has become a global mission.
